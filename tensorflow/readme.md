# Tensorflow experiments and models

This folder is a working repo of the tensorflow projects in current development by myself. There are some example models which I use yet most of work here is a brief showcase of ability to build models using purely tensorflow. 

### Following a path
How well can a model predict the next point along a path. Here we evaluate the ability of simple linear and non linear models to predict the next location in a path given to points from simple motion paths using a randomly generated dataset.

### Custom Dropout for RNNs (coming soon)
